# MY Favorite Destination

## Dubai-U.A.E

### Dubai Mall

>>The place was mesmerizing considering its the largest mall in the world! Its like a small city equipped with every item a human being needs. The amazing ski sports were incomparable to the hot weather on the outside. How can I forget the Dubai aquarium and underwater zoo. I actually saw "King croc" the largest crocodile in the whole world. Phew! What an experience.

### Morning Desert Safaris

>>Sand boarding was new and interesting to me. To top it up, the dune-bashing adventure was marveling from inside the tour >vehicles. The traditional Arabic food offered was such a delicacy we had never encountered. I also enjoyed riding a camel.
I am definitely visiting Dubai again soon.
